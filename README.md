# Eye-Movement-Onscreen
Eyes that follow based on mouse and click controls.
This was an assignment from class to understand how to operate and work with DOMS

HOW TO RUN
Load in the 3 files, eyes.js, index.html and styles.css. Once you are on the screen, you should be able to move your mouse around the desktop and the two eyes should follow the mouse.
Future changes, none I can think of for this. Maybe if I wanted to fully practice, I could add an event to create a pop up window when the mouse goes to close out the tab.
